# Collision-Detection-System

The incidence of road accidents has increased as technology and motor vehicle manufacture have advanced. Because proper emergency facilities are not available, the survival rate following an accident is extremely low. Our concept would assist in detecting an accident and determining its location, which would then be communicated to the rescue team and the riderâ€™s emergency contacts.
